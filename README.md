# Heavy Bass Preset For EasyEffects
This is a very simple bass boosting preset for [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects).

The idea behind this preset is to create an uncompromising bass boost by reducing treble via Equalizer, using the EasyEffects Bass Enhancer plugin to make bass punchier, and using a very soft Crystalizer to try to compensate for the reduced treble.

There are three variations.

**Heavy Bass**

    The main preset, makes the bass sound heavier. Reduces treble by about 1-6db depending on band.
**HB-Mid**

    This variant's equalizer reduces treble 25% less (1-4db) than the main preset but is otherwise unchanged.
**HB-Lite**

    This variant's equalizer reduces treble 50% less (1-3db) than the main preset but is otherwise unchanged.

It is recommended for users to try all three versions to find their preferred balance; there may also be different situations that call for a lighter/heavier treble reduction based on user preference.
